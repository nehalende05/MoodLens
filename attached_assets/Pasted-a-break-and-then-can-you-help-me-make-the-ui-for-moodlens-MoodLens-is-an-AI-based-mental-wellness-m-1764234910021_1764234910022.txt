a break and then can you help me make the ui for moodlens. MoodLens is an AI-based mental-wellness monitoring system that detects early signs of stress, fatigue, and low mood using real-time facial expression and voice-tone analysis. The solution leverages lightweight computer-vision and speech-processing models to analyze webcam and microphone inputs. When emotional strain is detected, the AI agent autonomously recommends suitable actions such as short breathing exercises, calming music, or positive affirmations.

The system follows an Agentic AI approach — it can perceive emotional cues, reason about the user’s state, and respond with context-aware support, without constant human prompts.

MoodLens promotes early mental-health awareness through continuous, non-intrusive emotional monitoring. It aims to reduce burnout and stress, especially among students and professionals, by providing a simple yet intelligent companion for emotional balance. i am doing a agentic ai based hackathon. i want to make a prototype with html, css, javascript and java and also python. so pls help me to do so. so as i mentioned that all libraries like deepface and pysttx3 should to be used for voice recognition. so the ui ux should look good. So my first website frame should have the project name with the tag like "Moodlens: where computer meets human vision." title should have. just below it should be written" Detect your mood in real-time using your face and voice — and get gentle, AI-powered wellness suggestions 🌿" should be aligned in centre and this should have violets glittery text colour .in the same page there should be two rectangle shaped buttons aligned in the centre of the page. the first box should be labelled as "cam mode" and the second should be "chat mode" it should be reAL time. if the user click the cam mode it should land on the other page which 50% of webpage shows the camera in use (real time) and at the bottom it shows a toggle (30% big in size) for on and off the camera. this should take real time analysis from the facial expression and voice tone. use Deepface and pyystx for speech recognition. now analyse the expressions especially the eyes on how sad or happy or anxious the user look. analyse the user's  voice when they talk about how they feel and use agentic ai for the solution. and tell user needs breathing exercise or a cycling session or listening to music , put all according to the agenetic ai's response . this shoud look like a therapist who is actually helping the person who is seeking for help who could not open up in real world. so in the very first web page where there were two options , so second one should be a ai chat bot, the key should hold "Chintu" written. it should be a very simple chat bot . so just after ill click the chintu option it will show me emotions , so then when ill select it , the selection will disappear (after selection) it will get biased and help with that particular emotion. like why you feels so? it should look a beginner friendly code. should have good colours for website app. it should look like a stary night but not with too much of a fluorescent color.
